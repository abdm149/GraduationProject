* This repository contains code for our paper **Attention-Guided Discriminative Region Localization for Bone Age Assessment** [Download Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00202)
* If you have any question about our paper or code, please don't hesitate to contact with me ahucomputer@126.com, we will update our repository accordingly

## Setup
* **Dataset** The RSNA dataset can be downloaded here [RSNA](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/rsna-bone-age) 

* **requirements** Python==3.6, tensorflow==1.9, keras = 2.1.6, opencv.

## Training
* Step 1: Generate *.npy Data with data_utils.py
* Step 2: Run main_classification.py to train classification model, the Attention Map and Heatmap will be saved according to the given path.
* The attention map will be generated by  GAPAttention(model,weights,'/raid/chenchao/code/BoneAge/BoneAge/data/train/')
* Step 3: Generate the Heatmap for the Hand Reigon, Region-1 and Region-2 one-by-one
* Step 4: Run data/crop_patches.py to crop the local patches for Hand, Region-1 and Region-2 according to the heatmap one-by-one.
* Step 5: Run main_aggregation.py to aggragate different local patches for BAA
* You can also run main_regression.py to get the BAA performance by using one local patch.
